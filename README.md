## üìú Project Overview

This repository is a collection of various practice projects and small applications developed in Java. It's designed to deepen my understanding of core Java language features, fundamental programming constructs, and key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through hands-on exercises.

## ‚ú® Projects / Exercises Included

Here are some of the projects and exercises included in this repository:

* **`ConsoleFundamentals` (Java Console Application):** A basic command-line application demonstrating core Java concepts such as variable declaration (`byte`, `int`, `String`), random number generation, conditional logic (`if-else`), `ArrayList` usage, and basic console output with ANSI color codes. It also includes `Thread.sleep` for pausing execution.
    * **File:** `ConsoleFundamentals.java` (or similar name chosen by you)
* **`MonkeySimulator` (Java Swing GUI Application):** A simple GUI application built with Java Swing that displays an image and text. It simulates a "monkey" performing random actions (eating, sleeping, making a voice) with pauses, demonstrating basic Swing components (`JFrame`, `JLabel`, `ImageIcon`), layout management (`BorderLayout`), and event looping for simulation.
    * **Files:** `MonkeySimulator.java` (main application file), potentially `Monkey.java` (for the `Monkey` class model).
* **[Exercise/Project Name 3]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A small program showcasing array manipulation and basic data structures."]
* [List all other exercises/mini-projects here with brief descriptions.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java (Specify your JDK version, e.g., Java 17)
* **IDE:** [e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code]
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these Java exercises, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Java-LearningExercises.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Java-LearningExercises.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the specific project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Java-LearningExercises/[ProjectOrExerciseName]
    ```
    * For `ConsoleFundamentals`: `cd Java-LearningExercises/ConsoleFundamentals`
    * For `MonkeySimulator`: `cd Java-LearningExercises/MonkeySimulator`
3.  **Compile the Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac [YourMainClass].java
    ```
    * For `ConsoleFundamentals`: `javac ConsoleFundamentals.java`
    * For `MonkeySimulator`: `javac MonkeySimulator.java Monkey.java` (if `Monkey.java` is a separate file)
4.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    java [YourMainClass]
    ```
    * For `ConsoleFundamentals`: `java ConsoleFundamentals`
    * For `MonkeySimulator`: `java MonkeySimulator`
    *(If using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, simply open the project and run it from within the IDE.)*

## üß† Learning & Development

These exercises have been crucial in building my proficiency in Java. I've focused on understanding [mention specific learning, e.g., exception handling, collections framework, file I/O, multithreading basics]. Each project provided an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical coding challenges and improve my debugging skills.
