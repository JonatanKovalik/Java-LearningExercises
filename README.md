## üìú Project Overview

This repository is a collection of various practice projects and small applications developed in Java. It's designed to deepen my understanding of core Java language features, fundamental programming constructs, and key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through hands-on exercises.

## ‚ú® Projects / Exercises Included

* **[Exercise/Project Name 1]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A basic command-line application demonstrating user input and conditional logic."]
* **[Exercise/Project Name 2]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Implementation of a simple class hierarchy to explore inheritance and polymorphism."]
* **[Exercise/Project Name 3]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A small program showcasing array manipulation and basic data structures."]
* [List all other exercises/mini-projects here with brief descriptions.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java [Version, e.g., Java 11 / Java 17]
* **IDE:** [e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code]
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these Java exercises, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Java-LearningExercises.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Java-LearningExercises.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Java-LearningExercises/[ProjectOrExerciseName]
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac [YourMainClass].java
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    java [YourMainClass]
    ```
    *(If using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, simply open the project and run it from within the IDE.)*

## üß† Learning & Development

These exercises have been crucial in building my proficiency in Java. I've focused on understanding [mention specific learning, e.g., exception handling, collections framework, file I/O, multithreading basics]. Each project provided an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical coding challenges and improve my debugging skills.
